# 🌦️ EXP2: Weather Modeling System Using SDLC Models

This project demonstrates how a **Weather Modeling System** can be developed using the **Quadratic Equation** approach (`ax² + bx + c = 0`) by applying three major **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** models:

- 🏗️ Waterfall Model
- 🔁 Iterative Model
- ⚡ Agile Model
